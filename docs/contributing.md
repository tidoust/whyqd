# Contributing to **whyqd**

We'd love you to support **whyqd**!

## Issues

Questions, feature requests and bug reports are all welcome as 
[discussions or issues](https://github.com/whythawk/whyqd/issues/new/choose).

Please include as much context as possible with your requests so others can replicate your problem, including any
dependencies or data sources.

To report a security vulnerability, please [contact us](https://whyqd.com/contact) so that we can get a fix out
as quickly as possible.

## Pull requests

Before making a pull request, please create an issue to discuss your proposed change.

There are a range of opportunities for getting into contributing, including:

- Expanding the documentation,
- Adding in additional 'action' scripts,
- Refactoring or optimising the code.

Please ensure you run tests locally. **whyqd** tests don't require a database and have few dependencies, so running them
doesn't take long and should be straightforward.

If you add in new features, please also add in tests and documentation.

!!! warning
    Keep focused. **whyqd** is a curatorial toolkit intended to produce well-structured and predictable data for 
    research analysis. It is **not** an analytical tool. Features related to data aggregation or analysis will not
    be considered.

## Financial support

**whyqd** [received initial funding](https://eoscfuture-grants.eu/meet-the-grantees/implementation-no-code-method-schema-schema-data-transformations-interoperability)
from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101017536. Technical 
development support is from [EOSC Future](https://eoscfuture.eu/) through the

Background and Contributing
===========================

**whyqd** is open-source and we welcome your support. This is very early in the release process, so
please have a look at the :doc:`roadmap`, or simply let me know what you think, what works, what
doesn't.

Background
----------

**whyqd** was created to serve a continuous data wrangling process, including collaboration on more
complex messy sources, ensuring the integrity of the source data, and producing a complete audit
trail from data imported to our database, back to source. You can see the product of that at
`Sqwyre.com <https://sqwyre.com>`_.

All the code (so far) has been written by `Gavin Chait <https://gavinchait.com>`_ with references in
the code to snippets from elsewhere.

In 2021, **whyqd** received financial support from the `Mayor's Resilience Fund <https://challenges.org/mayors-resilience/>`_,
the Mayor of London's £1 million challenge fund to incentivize innovators to address socially impactful issues facing 
London.

The 'backronym' for **whyqd** /wɪkɪd/ is *Whythawk Quantitative Data*, `Whythawk <https://whythawk.com>`_
is an open data science and open research technical consultancy.

Roadmap
=======

.. note:: **whyqd** has the single objective of transforming messy input data into a single standardised schema for 
  further validation and analyis in other software. Anything that goes further than that is out of scope.

That still leaves a fair amount to do, including improving the documentation and tests:

* pandas supports multiple fruity CSV formats (#\*-seperated, etc) - need a `config` to support these wilder problems
* Zip data files, method, and produce citation report as a single step to aid distribution
* Validate a zipped output file and produce a validation report
